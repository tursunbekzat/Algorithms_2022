Null - dont have any edges
trivial - have only one vertex
undirected - edges dont have any direction.Thats the nodes are unordered pairs in the definition of every edge. 
directed - which edge has direction.Thats the nodes are ordered pairs in the definition of every edge.
connected - graph in which from one node we can visit any other node in the graph.
disconnected - graph in which at least one node is not reachable from a node. 
regular - The graph in which the degree of every vertex is equal to the other vertices of the graph. Let the degree of each vertex be K then the graph
complete - The graph in which from each node there is an edge to each other node.
cycle - The graph in which the graph is a cycle in itself, the degree of each vertex is 2. 
cyclic - A graph containing at least one cycle is known as a Cyclic graph.
directed acyclic - A Directed Graph that does not contain any cycle
bipartite - A graph in which vertex can be divided into two sets such that vertex in each set does not contain any edge between them.
weighted - A graph in which the edges are already specified with suitable weight is known as a weighted graph. 
Weighted graphs can be further classified as directed weighted graphs and undirected weighted graphs.
